NXCore Data Munging

The following project is used to decompress NxCore Historical Tape files (highly compressed financial market data http://www.nanex.net/historical.html) created by Nanex, LLC. The C/C++/C# API requires the use of a Microsoft Windows dynamic-link library (NxCore.dll) which is provided with the historic tape files upon purchase.
